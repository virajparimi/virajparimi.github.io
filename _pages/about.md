Hi! I am Viraj, a Ph.D. student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge advised by [Prof. Brian C. Williams](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/brian-williams) in the [Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS)](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/). I am currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant in [Model-Based Embedded and Robotics Systems Group (MERS)](https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/model-based-embedded-and-robotics-systems-group) which is part of the broader [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL)](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) and the [Embodied Intelligence (EI)](https://ei.csail.mit.edu/) community at MIT. My research interest lies in the problem of safe skill-learning for robotic agents which spans diverse areas including robotics, AI planning, reinforcement learning and multi-agent systems. You can find some cool hardware demonstrations that I have worked on [here](https://www.youtube.com/@vparimi).

Before MIT, I obtained my M.Sc. in Robotics at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) in 2021 where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Stephen Smith](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/stephen-smith/). Prior to that, I earned my B.Tech. degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/) in 2019 where I worked under the mentorship of [Prof. Tanmoy Chakraborty](https://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~tanmoy/) and [Prof. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/PKguru/).

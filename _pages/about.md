Hi! I'm Viraj, a Ph.D. student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) advised by [Prof. Brian C. Williams](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/brian-williams). At [CSAIL's Model-Based Embedded and Robotics Systems Group (MERS)](https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/model-based-embedded-and-robotics-systems-group) and the [Embodied Intelligence community](https://ei.csail.mit.edu/), I design learning-enabled planners that help robots reason safely in the wild.

## Research Focus
- **Scalable multi-agent planning.** Exploiting planning frameworks that decompose large multi-agent problems into tractable subproblems and re-compose them through conflict resolution, precedence reasoning, and hierarchical task structures.
- **Risk-aware autonomy.** Developing risk-aware algorithms that maintain global safety guarantees through dynamic risk budgeting, iterative risk reallocation, and skill chaining under uncertainty.
- **Learning-guided planning.** Integrating diffusion models, vision-language models(VLMs), and reinforcement learning with search-based methods to accelerate long-horizon task completion, improve generalization, and enable data-efficient closed-loop control.
- **Representation learning for coordination.** Learning structured latent spaces that encode notions of safety, cooperation, and temporal consistency, enabling interpolation-based reasoning and scalable multi-agent policy adaptation.

## Background
- Graduate Research Assistant, MIT EECS

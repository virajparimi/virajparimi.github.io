We evolved the Carnegie Classification framework to suit the Indian higher-education landscape by proposing quantitative criteria based on research funding, faculty strength, doctoral enrollment, and research output. Applying the rubric to the top 100 universities and engineering institutions surfaced 40 universities and 32 engineering colleges that qualify as research HEIs, offering policymakers a clearer snapshot of national research capacity.

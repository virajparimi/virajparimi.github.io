Evolved an approach to classify research universities in India, based on the Carnegie Classification approach. We proposed a simple basic criterion for identifying research universities, and apply it to the top 100 universities and top 100 engineering institutions in India. Using this criteria, 40 universities and 32 engineering institutions were identified as research higher education insititutes (HEIs).

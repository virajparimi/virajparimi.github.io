title: "Sample-Based Planning under Discrete Space"
excerpt: "Proposed a hierarchical decomposition algorithm where we discretize the continuous sample space of PRM/RRT algorithms in order to provide tighter completeness guarantees. Demonstrated the performance improvement of the proposed approach for 6-link robotic arm"

Introduced dRRT, a discrete sampling-based planner that uses Bresenham's line algorithm and techniques from search-based planning to achieve anytime qualities and reuse computation. Results on planning for a 5-DOF robotic arm demonstrate faster performance than traditional RRT.

  In this paper, we study the role of nodes and edges in a complex network in dictating the robustness of a community structure toward structural perturbations. Specifically, we attempt to identify all vital nodes, which, when removed, would lead to a large change in the underlying community structure of the network. This problem is critical because the community structure of a network allows us to explore deep underlying insights into how the function and topology of the network affect each other. Moreover, it even provides a way to condense large networks into smaller modules where each community acts as a meta node and aids in more straightforward network analysis. If the community structure were to be compromised by either accidental or intentional perturbations to the network that would make such analysis difficult. Since identifying such vital nodes is computationally intractable, we propose a suite of heuristics that allow to find solutions close to the optimality. To show the effectiveness of our approach, we first test these heuristics on small networks and then move to more extensive networks to show that we achieve similar results. Further analysis reveals that the proposed approaches are useful to analyze the vulnerability of communities in networks irrespective of their size and scale. Additionally, we show the performance through an extrinsic evaluation framework—we employ two tasks, i.e., link prediction and information diffusion, and show that the effect of our algorithms on these tasks is higher than the other baselines.

We introduce scalable heuristics for detecting “vital” nodes whose removal fractures community structure, and validate the impact through link prediction and information diffusion evaluations.

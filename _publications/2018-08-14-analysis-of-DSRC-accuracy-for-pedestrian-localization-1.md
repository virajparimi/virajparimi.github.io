Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) are a standard of communications designed for vehicle-tovehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. This technology offers significant promise for improving pedestrian safety, as it allows pedestrians to communicate directly with nearby infrastructure elements and vehicles, and offers more precise GPS localization. Our work shows the current standard is too imprecise at low speeds, and as such cannot be used for pedestrian localization. We propose a method to increase the accuracy of DSRC GPS readings at low velocities and to increase precision by utilizing both iPhone and DSRC GPS readings
